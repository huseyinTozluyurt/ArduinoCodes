# Capacitive Touch Calculator
<hr>
A physical calculator by using microcontroller Arduino Nano and 16 x 2 LCD screen with I2C module 
and 2 capacitive touch sensors that detects the change of the electrical charges of the metal coin
and the change of electrical charges are measured by the microcontroller by using the Arduino
library called Capacitive Sensor by Paul Badger and Paul Stoffregen.

## Requirements 
- Arduino Nano
- 16 x 2 LCD screen with I2C module
- 2 conductive materials as capacitive sensor connected to the Arduino
- Wires
